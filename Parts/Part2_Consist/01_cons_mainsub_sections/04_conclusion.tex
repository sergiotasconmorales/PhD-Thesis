\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we presented a novel method for improving consistency in \gls{vqa} models in cases where answers to sub-questions imply those of main questions and vice-versa. By using a tailored training procedure and loss function that measures the level of inconsistency, we show on the application of \gls{dme} staging, that our approach provides important improvements in both \gls{vqa} accuracy and consistency. In addition, we show that our method's hyperparameters are relatively insensitive to model performance. In the future, we plan to investigate how this approach can be extended to the broader case of unconstrained question relations.
